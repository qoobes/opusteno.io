# Action Plan

So this is basically a plan of what I'll be doing next.

 - ~~Transfer form to '/form' (GET)~~
     - ~~Set up an endpoint '/form' and transfer the code there~~
 - Do '/auth' endpoints
     - ~~Figure out how to properly use nodemailer~~
     - ~~Only send @2gimnazija.edu.ba emails~~
     - ~~Send to the same email every minute, and from the same session every minute~~
     - Figure out how to properly use JWT to send confirmation mails
     - Implement the stuffs
 - Do POST '/form' for sending the mails 
     - Pretty damn easy and even more self explanatory
